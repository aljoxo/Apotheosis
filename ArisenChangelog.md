### Removed

 - NPC AI Process Position Fix - SSE  
    - Reason: Redundant.  
 - NPCs Use Potions  
    - Reason: Caused crash issues with ZUPA.  
 - Kinnari Armor  
    - Reason: Armor didn't really fit well thematically and I didn't have a good idea of how to implement it.  
 - Fists of Fury  
    - Reason: For some reason Maul's dialogue would never trigger the progression of the quest. Unfortunately this wasn't something I was able to find or develop a fix for, so the mod was cut.  
 - Know Your Enemy  
    - Reason: Using the original KYE mod + Synthesis Patcher is a much less clean implementation than the newer Redux versions and was a mistaken choice in early development because I just chose what mod I had used in the past. Swapping to the SPID version should be more user friendly and less prone to compatability errors.    
 - Nether's Follower Framework  
    - Reason: N/A  
 - Mirai  
    - Reason: Decided I didn't like this follower that much and no one was using her.  
 - Gray Cowl of Nocturnal  
    - Reason: [I Love Democracy](https://discord.com/channels/1008047161281347606/1009605729939894343/1022166433276379257).  
 - Duncan's Grey Cowl Paper Maps for FWMF  
    - Reason: GCoN Depedency.  
 - Aetherius  
    - Reason: Didn't require this mod as a dependency for the new Race changes.  
 - Serana Dialogue Edit - Skyrim Special Edition  
    - Reason: SDA Update.  
 - Post Hit Killmoves  
    - Reason: Unnecessary mod.  
 - CatHub
    - Reason: Unnecessary mod.
 - Volumetric Mists  
    - Reason: Swapped mist mods.  
 - Scion  
    - Reason: Read Dev Notes.  
 - Manbeast  
    - Reason: Read Dev Notes.  
 - Cover Your Head - Scion  
    - Reason: Scion Dependency.  
 - Archery Gameplay Overhaul  
    - Reason: Bad mod.  
 - Archery Gameplay Overhaul - Settings Loader  
    - Reason: AGO Dependency.  
 - Skyrim Search  
    - Reason: Dev tool that user had no use for and it caused issues with starting up the game for some.  
 - LOTD Wintersun Patch  
    - Reason: Primarily did this to see if it has any positive or negative effect on the stuck script issue that some people experience. *(note that this is just a disabled `.esp`, it's still actually in the list if you want to enable it yourself, but if you post about the script getting stuck I will temp ban you)*  
 - A lot of bodyslide presets
    - Reason: I wanted to take a different approach and redo morph.ini stuff for autobody because I felt some of the presets felt out of place in the list. Due to what I did, adding bodyslides is no longer plug and play, so please read the [How to add a bodyslide](https://github.com/aljoxo/Arisen#q-how-do-i-add-a-bodyslide-to-the-list) section of the readme.  
 - Myrkvior - The Flora of Skyrim - Trees
    - Reason: Read Dev Notes.
 - Morekvior
    - Reason: Read Dev Notes. 
 - Morekvior 3D Hybrid LOD
    - Reason: Read Dev Notes. 
 - Myrkvior 3D Hybrid LOD
    - Reason: Read Dev Notes. 
 - TFoS Aspens RAT
    - Reason: Read Dev Notes. 
 - TFoS Large Juniper Trees in the Reach
    - Reason: Read Dev Notes. 

### Dev Notes

 - New mechanic [Special Attacks](https://github.com/aljoxo/Arisen/blob/main/Documentation/Special%20Attacks%20Wiki.md).

 - Reworked Attack movesets for player and NPCs.

 - Fixed the pre-hit frame on Maces so they will actually consume stamina on light attacks.

 - New Sword moveset.

### Updated
 
 - Lux main plugin

### Added

 - Talina RaceMenu Preset (from Arkay)

### Removed

 - Better Telekinesis  
    - Reason: Caused issues with Vampire transformations.  

### Dev Notes

 - Fixed Vampire transformation crashes.
 - Edited `aljo's Wacky CR` and `Synthesis3`. Because this is a critical error, these edited files will be hosted in the discord for those who already downloaded 1.3.1.2 so they do not have to fully redownload the list.
 - Fixed Karliah's Face. I love EasyNPC failing to properly pack textures.
 - Fixed Lux lighting. (Due to the sheer amount of patches I had to fix here, I'm not going to be hosting these)
 - Fixed an MCM option that was left over from my Dev build. (this won't cause any issues if you don't have it).
 - Reverted some bosses that were incorrectly set to be Dragon Priests.
 - Fixed anvil texture.
 - Fixed issue that caused actors to stagger off any hit.
 - Remade start save so people wouldn't get the missing esp error from the removed mod.
 - This update is save safe with version 1.3.1+ .... unless you have a spell from the removed mod, then it probably isn't.

### Removed 

 - CLOUDS
    - Reason: Skybox seams.
 - Dwemer Gates No Relock
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Sharpen Other Swords
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Sacrilege
    - Reason: There was a bug with Skyrim Unbound and Sacrilege in which choosing to become a vampire via the Skyrim Unbound MCM menu had a chance of breaking the Sacrilege VampirePlayerQuest script, causing Vampiric Drain (and other Vampire abilities) to not work correctly.
 - Growl
    - Reason: Due to the removal of Sacrilege in favor of Scion, I believed it was only fair, and sensical from a balance POV, to also replace Growl with Simon's version.
 - Sacrilege - Remove Auspex Sound
    - Reason: Requires Sacrilege
 - Cover Your Head - Sacrilege
    - Reason: Requires Sacrilege
