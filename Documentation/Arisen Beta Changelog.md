 - Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim
    - Reason: I felt a lot of the spells were feature overlaps or very unbalanced compared to other spells in the list. As a result I decided that it would be a good long term decision for my sanity and for my vision of the list to take it out. It's possible a very modified version of some Apocalypse spells may come back in the future, but as of now the mod will remain removed.

 - Ryn's Halted Stream Camp
    - Reason: Performance for this mod was sadly too poor to keep it in the list, regardless of how cool the area was.
 - Carved Brink 
    - Reason: Bad mod/kinda buggy.
       - Carved Brink - Modpocalypse
       - Carved Brink - High Poly NPCs
 - Skyrim's Got Talent - Improve as a Bard
    - Reason: No one really used the mod, sometimes it caused a weird interaction with the "Performing Badly" mgef. Decided it should be cut.
 - Ghosts of the Tribunal - Voiced Narrative (Creation Club)
    - Reason: Redundant Mod.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Solitude
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Morthal

 - Dibella's Blessing - Windhelm
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Markarth
    - Reason: Redundant mod.

    - Reason: Old mod, had certain issues, and the features utilized from the mod (specifically creature special attacks, etc) could be redone using DAR.
 - Realistic Dark Brotherhood Kidnapping
    - Reason: Seemed unnecessary.
 - VIGILANT - HiRes Pack 01
    - Reason: Mod updated.
 - VIGILANT - HiRes Pack 02

 - Adamant - Talos Tweaks
    - Reason: Integrated in Pilgrim.
 - Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim
    - Reason: Pilgrim's perk implementation of Blessings, as well as misc other features made me want to swap Religion mods. Also Pilgrim is just generally better implemented into the list in terms of blessing balance.

 - Sales Overflow Solved
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Elven Chainmail
    - Reason: Armor wasn't well integrated and no one seemed to use it.
 - Majestic Mountains - Northside
    - Reason: Wanted to change things up and the mod was not going to be updated for new Majestic Mountains.
 - The Northern Diaries - Skyrim and Solstheim
    - Reason: Cleaning up music mods that had limited number of tracks that weren't used or were overwritten.

       - Morag Tong Grandmaster HIMBO

        - Custom Skills - GLENMORIL English Translation
 - Zim's Dragon Improvements
    - Reason: Was primarily using this mod for the Dragon renaming function. Since another mod does it better with less bloat, this mod is getting cut for future proofing.
 - Custom Skills Menu NORDIC UI Patch
    - Reason: Removing the CSF Trees.
 - Custom Skills Menu - A Custom Skills Framework Unified Menu
    - Reason: Removing the CSF Trees.

    - Reason: Between the visual inconsistencies caused by the mod and the performance hit, on top of the fact that many ENB authors are now moving away from EVLaS, we decided to remove it.

 - Heavy Armory
    - Reason: Added many redundant weapons to the loot pool without adding anything that wasn't already covered by other mods.
       - Animated Armor - Heavy Armoury Compatibility Patch
       - OWL - Heavy Armory Patch
 - For Honor in Skyrim I Nobushi
    - Reason: Weapon type is gone now.
 - Smooth's For Honor in Skyrim Gladiator
    - Reason: Weapon type is gone now.
 - Unplayable Factions Armor
    - Reason: Conflicted with a lot of other armor distributions so I decided to remove it in favor of some fresher armors.

    - Reason: Wasn't well integrated.
       - Xtudo's Dark Knight HIMBO
 - Imperial Guard Centurion Armor SE
    - Reason: Conflicted with other legion armor replacers so I decided to cut it.
       - JS Imperial Guard Centurion Armor - SSE CBBE
       - Imperial Guard Centurion Armor HIMBO
 - [Christine] Forsworn Retribution
    - Reason: Armor wasn't well integrated.
 - Khash the Argonian
    - Reason: A lot of people seemed to like this follower but she had some issues that I got tired of dealing with and I was starting to be uncomfortable with including essentially a child as a follower. Sorry not sorry.
 - Armors of Velothi Pt. 1
    - Reason: Conflicted with other armor distributions, mod had certain issues and lacked proper female bodyslides, so I decided to get rid of it. Pt. 2 was not included due to being chalked full of quality control issues.
 - Experience
    - Reason: New Skill Up and Leveling system.
 - Static Skill Leveling (Experience Mod Add-On)
    - Reason: New Skill Up and Leveling system.
       - Skill Rate Remover (Static Skill Leveling Patches)
 - Difficulty Balance
    - Reason: Redundant Mod.
 - Copy and Paste in Console
    - Reason: PO3's mod takes care of this function now.
 - Constellations - A Standing Stones Improvement
    - Reason: New Standing Stone mod.
 - Skyrim Diffusion (SD) Loading Screens
    - Reason: After some debate, decided to remove the mod for some ethical reasons.
 - Bears of the North
    - Reason: Decided the massive bears didn't fit very well and they had some wack hitboxes.
 - Improved Skyrim Remastered - Glaciers and Ice Collision
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Populated Dungeons
    - Reason: Poorly made mod, better alternative now included.
 - Riekling Barrels SMIM
    - Reason: Rally's Barrels replace this.
 - Rally's Mead Barrels
    - Reason: Rally's Barrels replace this.
 - SMIM Barrel Expansion - Mead Barrel - Oil Barrel - Butter Churn
    - Reason: Rally's Barrels replace this.
 - Configurable Commentary Rate Slider
    - Reason: Broke Remiel's quest and seemed to be causing some other issues with Follower banter.
 - Valhalla Combat - Race Addons
    - Reason: dTry said this mod was no longer necessary with the update, and it was more or less a redundant mod anyways since we didn't utilize the execution system.
 - Strange Runes
    - Reason: This mod had a couple of weird interactions due to attaching a light source to the player and some individuals had reported issues it caused with casting.
 - Zim's Immersive Artifacts
    - Reason: New Artifacts revamp.
 - Valhalla Combat
    - Reason: Major backstab bug + the fact the mod was already cut down to being only utilized for Timed Blocks. Timed Blocks nullified the entire block tree + were just generally very overpowered. This might be a temporary removal, we'll see based on feedback and more playtesting.

    - Reason: Redundant mod.

    - Reason: This mod has been functionally replaced with Delta's wonderful Dragon Cult mod!

    - Reason: Honestly I am extremely satisfied with the feel and challenge of Delta's Dragon Cult mod. I don't think Awoken Draugr added much to the game besides showing off animations more, and I don't really know if that was a good thing or not. I also didn't feel like re-consistency patching the entire Draugr MCO mod to fit better into the new Draugr from Dragon Cult. Depending on feedback this change may be reverted.
 - Much Better Night Mother
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Simplest Horses (and other mounts)
    - Reason: . . . 
 - Honed Metal
    - Reason: Balancing concerns.
 - Simple Werewolf Favourite Howls Menu
    - Reason: Manbeast has its own implementation.

       - Changed Twin Secrets perk to Law of Equivalent Exchange.
    - Nerfed Weakness to Frost enchant on Chillrend.
       - Due to changes in the "Resist Frost" values of most actors in the list vs Vanilla Skyrim and the Resist Caps, 30% seemed more in line with the rest of the list's design than the original 50% debuff.

       - Blood Vapors (VIGILANT) was nerfed by 100% because it was way too strong.
       - Bosses were buffed if necessary.
 - Removed Know Your Enemy and Know Your Armor.
 - Tuning for Dragon Priests, Ancano, and Orchendor.

 - Reinstalled HDT-SMP with different settings in hope of better system compatibility.
 - Quick Loot menu will no longer show in combat. To revert this change, just edit the `.toml` file in the mod.
