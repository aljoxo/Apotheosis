# Special Attacks

## What are they?

Here is a basic wiki page explaining what the special attack mechanics actually do (and how much they cost to perform) for those interested. All Special Attacks are immune to recoil during the animation and are given hyperarmor (Tackle can also be performed during the animations since they count as Power Attacks), however the player can still be staggered.

## How to Use

Special Attacks are activated pressing a modifer key and the Power Attack keybind. Special Attacks cost **magicka** and **stamina**, and the amount varies by the specific attack. 
 - The modifier key can be changed in the `Ashes of War.ini` found in the `[Path to Modlist]\mods\!!! Ashes of War !!!\SKSE\plugins\dtryKeyUtil\config\custom` folder. By default, the modifier key is set to `L CTRL` for Keyboards and `A` for Gamepads.  
     - **DO NOT SET THE MODIFIER KEY TO BE THE SAME AS YOUR SPRINT KEY**.
